    <p>My current love for mathematics was kickstarted by a professor in college, 
        who showed me that math is a <i>human</i> craft; 
        a mathematician is not a number-crunching robot, but a flesh-and-blood person, 
        which means their work is as full of passion, grit, and even joy as a playwright's or sculptor's. 
        It is my firm belief that math is accessible to anyone, however far they choose to pursue it, 
        and it is my job as an educator to make my students believe this for themselves.

    <p>The Mathemagician nodded knowingly and stroked his chin several times. "You’ll find," he remarked gently, "that the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that’s hardly worth the effort."
