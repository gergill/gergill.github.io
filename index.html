    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>I am a mathematican and data analyst currently working on my PhD (expected 2026) under the direction of <a href = "http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~idarcy">Isabel Darcy</a> and <a href = https://internalmedicine.medicine.uiowa.edu/profile/william-thiel>William Thiel</a> at the University of Iowa.</p>
    <p>My primary research is in topological data analysis, a field which touches algebraic and geometric topology, statistics, and computer science; 
        it also frequently involves collaboration with experts from non-mathematical fields, such as biology or neuroscience.

    <p>"I don't know of any wrong road to Dictionopolis, 
        so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all it must be the right road, 
        and if it doesn't it must be the right road to somewhere else, 
        because there are no wrong roads to anywhere. Do you think it will rain?"
