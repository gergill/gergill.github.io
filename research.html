    <p>"How can you see something that isn't there?" yawned the Humbug, who wasn't fully awake yet.<br><br>"Sometimes, it's much simpler than seeing things that are," he said. "For instance, if something is there, you can only see it with your eyes open, but if it isn't there, you can see it just as well with your eyes closed. That's why imaginary things are often easier to see than real ones."<br><br>"Then where is Reality?" barked Tock.<br><br>"Right here," cried Alec, waving his arms.
